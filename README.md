### Instructions:
- enter the file path blog/joke-blog to access the joke blog
- ignore that it says a1

#### Problems I ran into:
- can't get it to run on github pages it runs this readme instead of static pages
- can't get it to show images or go to the proper page on Netlify. Fixed by changing the route in config file.
- can't get it to show blog on Netlify
- added multiple blogs and it broke my code
