#### Problems I ran into:
- can't get it to run on github pages it runs this readme instead of static pages
- can't get it to show images or go to the proper page on Netlify. Fixed by changing the route in config file.
- can't get it to show blog on Netlify
- added multiple blogs and it broke my code
- #1 Web Dev Team helped me finish my assignment today because they're awesome. (Icah especially, and James and Filora provided emotional support)
- Second page wasn't loading. Icah fixed for me.
- Content wasn't loading. Icah found the problem in content=jokes should be content=joke
